# Conway's Game of Life

 A C# implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## About
 This project is a first year assignment that involved making Conway's life game in C#. The graphical interface was not made by me and was simply provided to me. The goal of the assignment was to manipulate a two-dimensional array and make it evolve with simple rules. It is possible to make it evolve step by step by displaying intermediate states (cells about to be born or die displayed in color).
